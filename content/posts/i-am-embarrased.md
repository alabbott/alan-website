I have been pulled over for taillights being out and pulled over while legally carrying a concealed firearm. My behavior and dialogue was pretty much exactly the same as this video. Philando Castile was shot and killed; I got off with a warning.

I regularly run outside and have never been afraid of being murdered. Ahmaud Arbery was chased down and gunned down while going for a run in his own neighborhood and his killers went free for months.

My parents have never had to tell me how to interact with the police so that I don't get killed. Young black men and boys have to be told how to behave so hopefully that are not shot by police someday.

As a child, I loved playing with toy guns with my friends, regularly at parks and public places, and was never concerned about being shot by police. Tamir Rice was.

I have never worried about the police murdering me in my own home. Breonna Taylor was killed in her own home while doing nothing at all.

I am embarrassed it has taken me this long to say something publicly. Not speaking out against oppression is the same as agreeing with and condoning it. I have watched my friends be held to double standards and judged just for the color of their skin and it is not okay. Not for them and not for anyone. This may be uncomfortable and you might not want to see it but it's important.

I have watched black friends of mine, who have similar upbringings and educational backgrounds, who hold the same jobs and hobbies as me, be judged and assumed to be dangerous or criminals just because of the color of their skin or because they have tattoos. Do you know who else has tattoos? My mom. And I don't think anyone has ever asked her if she was in a gang. It is long past time for the double standards and systemic racism in this country to end. It has to stop.

I don't think anybody deserves to die for any of the things I listed above. If so, I am certainly guilty of the same things. I think the most cut and dry example is George Floyd. A man who was already in handcuffs and restrained was suffocated in front of a crowd of people. This isn't how justice in America is supposed to work! Regardless of whether he had committed a crime or not he has a right to a trial with a jury of his peers. He has a right to live. Even with rapists and murderers we give them a trial and do not murder them in the streets.

My parents have told me over and over again that they would do anything for me to keep me safe. Yet we criticize people like Colin Kaepernick for peacefully protesting the violence that has gone on for centuries. What would you do to keep your sons and daughters, brothers and sisters safe? You would probably do a lot more than sit during the national anthem. What would you do if your children had been murdered and the people who did it went unpunished? Would you sit down and shut up? Or would you be yelling? Screaming? Starting fires?

I understand that there are right and wrong ways to protest and while I do not condone violence, if your peaceful protests are shut down and ignored I think it is absolutely appropriate to escalate. Martin Luther King Jr. said riots are the language of the unheard. It's time that we all listen and understand what it is we haven't been hearing.

I would also like to address police brutality and the thin blue line, blue code of silence, Blue Lives Matter, etc. These are important concepts and there are good and bad police and the good ones outweigh the bad ones by a lot, but cultures and norms that don't allow bad officers to be exposed and removed from power and punished when they abuse their power need to end. As an Aggie, I have always been taught that Aggies do not lie, cheat, or steal nor tolerate those who do. If we tolerate bad police and those who abuse their power, we are just as responsible as the ones doing the abusing. Silence is agreeing and supporting that behavior and it must stop.

Lastly, the use of force I've seen is absolutely absurd. We need to deescalate rather than fight back. I've seen videos of police patrolling streets and shooting people watching on their porches with pepper spray paintballs. In AMERICA! People have been seriously and permanently injured by these. People who were not presenting and harm or danger to anyone. I have included links to examples of these incidents below.

MLK Jr. said these types of protests will continue until we hear the oppressed black people in America and finally start to have the uncomfortable conversations about what justice looks like. I don't know what the answer is and it's not my place to decide, but I can't be silent any more and condone the violence and double standards that my fellow Americans have had to deal with for far too long.
