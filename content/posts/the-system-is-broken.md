My trust in police is gone. The system is broken. Over the past week I have seen countless videos of police brutalizing and beating people, shooting them with rubber bullets and tear gas canisters, which have both proved to be weapons capable of maiming and killing. These are not looters and rioters that are being attacked - by and large they are people who have gathered to peacefully protest and demand justice and accountability for the excessive use of force by police. How do the police respond? By brutally beating and maiming the citizens who just want to be heard. I am proud to live in a country where we have a right to the freedom of speech, assembly and press. I am distraught and ashamed to see the people exercising these rights being met with violence. This system is broken.

We need to carefully consider ways to actually protect and serve our communities. The police do not exist to protect and serve. They are not here to serve our communities. People who protect and serve need tools and resources, not weapons and MRAPs. Protecting and serving asks "how can I help you?" not "do as I say or I will kill you." Protecting and serving gets rid of bad apples, it does not shelter them. Protecting and serving admits mistakes and takes responsibility. Protecting and serving isn’t about asserting authority, it's about helping those in need. Protecting and serving doesn’t discriminate based on health, status, or the color of your skin.

I believe we can start by demilitarizing our police forces. We can end qualified immunity and require accountability. We can end the "blue wall of silence" culture that protects police who abuse their power. We can invest in resources for the homeless and mentally ill, specifically trained groups to handle their problems. We can require police to deescalate situations before using force. We can demand that all people receive protection equally. We have an opportunity to create systems that will actually help build up our communities, but first we need to recognize we have a problem. This system is broken.
