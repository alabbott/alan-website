Intro Paragraph
Skills learned

As I've learned more about tech, cybersecurity, and small electronics I've come across a number of little devices, projects, and "hacking" tools such as the Flipper Zero and Rubber Duckies. For an ethical hacker or penetration tester, these can be valuable tools to help audit the security of businesses, identifying weak spots and helping to improve them before someone with ill will comes along.

One of these projects I found is the Pwnagotchi.

## What is a Pwnagotchi?

From the documentation: "Pwnagotchi is an A2C-based “AI” powered by bettercap and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W that learns from its surrounding WiFi environment in order to maximize the crackable WPA key material it captures."

The device resembles a cute little electronic pet, the Tamagotchi, only instead of feeding it cartoon food, you feed it Wi-Fi handshakes. A handshake is the process used to authenticate a new device joining a Wi-Fi network.
