A mount to hold your U-Lock to your bike!

This is the result of several iterations and proved to be a great learning experience. From the first version shattering as soon as I hit a curb to the current version tipping over when printing due to no supports, it was a really fun and useful way to learn more about 3D design and FDM printing.
