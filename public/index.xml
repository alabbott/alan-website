      <description>I recently moved into a new apartment and decided I needed to upgrade my home network. I still had a router that I got in college but I knew the technology had moved forward since then. I was also frustrated by my previous roommate’s wifi situation. I had dead spots in my room that made streaming difficult and I heard about it frequently.
We also qualify for fiber internet at the new apartment, and I could get near gigabit speeds for $55/month through RCN.</description>

      <description>My fiancé and I recently moved into a place with a good sized outdoor space, at least for Chicago. I decided to use the space to plant a vegetable garden, set up a grill and lights and hang my hammock. I was pretty overwhelmed at first, I had gardened with my dad before but that was years ago and I wasn’t taking thoughtful notes about the whole process. As a result I felt like I was starting from zero but luckily I was able to put together and revise a plan pretty quickly.</description>

      <description>Hi! My name is Alan.
I would describe myself as a builder, adventurer, someone who is constantly curious and wanting to learn more. I&amp;rsquo;m rarely satisfied with sitting still, not asking questions, or being told something isn&amp;rsquo;t possible. I like a good challenge and I&amp;rsquo;m constantly fascinated by the world around me.
I have been working with computers for nearly as long as I can remember, initially taking them apart and sometimes putting them back together.</description>
