      <description>Hi! My name is Alan.
I would describe myself as a builder, adventurer, someone who is constantly curious and wanting to learn more. I&amp;rsquo;m rarely satisfied with sitting still, not asking questions, or being told something isn&amp;rsquo;t possible. I like a good challenge and I&amp;rsquo;m constantly fascinated by the world around me.
I have been working with computers for nearly as long as I can remember, initially taking them apart and sometimes putting them back together.</description>
