      <description>Replacement mount for the Kryptonite R-30 rear bike light.
This was one of my first attempts at using 3D design and FDM printing to create something functional for myself. I thought I had lost the light when I was cleaning up my bike for the spring and decide to toss the mount. As luck would have it I did not lose the light, and found it to be still very functional and bright.</description>

      <description>A mount to hold your U-Lock to your bike!
This is the result of several iterations and proved to be a great learning experience. From the first version shattering as soon as I hit a curb to the current version tipping over when printing due to no supports, it was a really fun and useful way to learn more about 3D design and FDM printing.
This design can be found for free on Thangs.</description>
