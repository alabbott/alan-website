<p>Replacement mount for the Kryptonite R-30 rear bike light.</p>
<p>This was one of my first attempts at using 3D design and FDM printing to create something functional for myself. I thought I had lost the light when I was cleaning up my bike for the spring and decide to toss the mount. As luck would have it I did not lose the light, and found it to be still very functional and bright. Of course now I had no way to attach the light to my bike. Enter Fusion 360 and a Prusa i3 MK3S and I was off to the races, or at least pretending I&rsquo;m racing down the LFT.</p>
