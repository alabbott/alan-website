<p>Hi! My name is Alan.</p>
<p>I would describe myself as a builder, adventurer, someone who is constantly curious and wanting to learn more. I&rsquo;m rarely satisfied with sitting still, not asking questions, or being told something isn&rsquo;t possible. I like a good challenge and I&rsquo;m constantly fascinated by the world around me.</p>
<p>I have been working with computers for nearly as long as I can remember, initially taking them apart and sometimes putting them back together. Before I was 12 I had fixed one of the old computers that had been redirected from the trash to me.</p>
<p>I decided I wanted to make my own website and soon dove into MS FrontPage 2003 before abandoning it for raw HTML and CSS. Before long I was hosting a LAMP server in my bedroom (talk to your kids about linux before it&rsquo;s too late) and writing PHP applications in my spare time. Since then I have had a passion for technology and all of the wonderful things it enables.</p>
<p>Nowadays I&rsquo;m running Kubernetes clusters in the cloud and building applications in Python, JavaScript, React, and Rust. The servers are no longer in my bedroom and syntax is a little different but I still love building things and working with the tech that powers them.</p>
<p>Offline I&rsquo;m a climber, skier, mountaineer, amateur natrualist and sometimes artist. I love to ride my bike around Chicago or go sailing on Lake Michigan. Really any way of moving through space or learning more about the world around me gives me joy.</p>
<p>Professionally, I work as an Enterprise Solution Consultant in the manufacturing industry.  I get to help people solve tough problems while seeing how just about everything gets made. I like my job becuase I get to lean into the tech while watching the creativity that makes just about everything I touch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always happy to chat about interesting problems and open to new opportunities. You can email me <a href="mailto:alan.l.abbott@gmail.com">here</a> or reach out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanabbott/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
